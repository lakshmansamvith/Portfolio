# Lakshman Samvith Dunna

## Introduction
I previously interned at Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu and worked Full Time in there, however I am currently a NEET (Not in Education, Employment, or Training) due to unforeseen circumstances that forced me to return to India without pursuing my plans in the US(situation related to my family members and my requirement here). However, I am actively seeking job opportunities here and would greatly appreciate any assistance or recommendations.

## Professional Development
Despite the challenges I faced, I have utilized this time to improve myself professionally. I have dedicated myself to enhancing my skills in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and have thoroughly refreshed my knowledge of .NET Core, React, and Azure. I am determined to reenter the job market and contribute my expertise in these areas.

## Portfolio Website
Although I haven't invested much time in creating a portfolio website, I have managed to create one in a single day. While it may not be extensive, it provides a glimpse into my skills and capabilities. Currently, I am also working on side projects to further enhance my abilities, particularly in server-side rendering (Next.js) and .NET Core development.

## Job Opportunities
If you come across any job opportunities that align with my skills and qualifications, I would greatly appreciate it if you could refer me. Given the current market scenario, I understand that opportunities may be limited, but I remain optimistic and eager to contribute to a suitable position.

## Contact Information
Thank you for considering my request, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any recommendations or further information.
