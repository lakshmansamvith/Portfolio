       aboutWork :`During my software development experience, I primarily focused on backend web development using N Tier Architecture Web APIs with .NET Core and SQL. I developed and implemented new features for three APIs and ensured seamless integration with the frontend. One notable achievement was implementing Redis caching, which greatly improved system performance by optimizing data retrieval and reducing response times.

       Although my main role was in backend development, I also took on React tasks to expand my frontend knowledge. While I'm not an expert in React, I proactively learned and completed various tasks, ensuring smooth integration between frontend and backend components.
       
       To maintain code quality, I wrote N Unit Tests for the backend, Jest tests for the front end,  identifying and resolving issues early on to ensure application stability. Overall, my experience revolves around backend web development with N Tier Architecture Web APIs microservices, where I actively participated in API development, feature implementation, frontend integration, and performance optimization using Redis caching. While my frontend skills are not as extensive as my backend expertise, I've taken the initiative to learn and work with React to bridge the gap between frontend and backend development tasks.`,
